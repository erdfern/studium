    "- Each group must register for a slot in studIP for the defense.\n",
    "- Successful defense means that a team member selected by us explains the solution and answers questions about it.\n",
    "- ChatGPT and other tools may be used, but must be cited.\n",
    "- The code must be explained without any aids.\n",
    "- We will not only evaluate the correctness of the results, but also whether the code is efficient, easy to understand, tidy and well documented.\n",
    "- Each group submits only one solution as a zip file, which is provided with the name and student number of a group member. For example, `mustermann_12345678.zip`. "
