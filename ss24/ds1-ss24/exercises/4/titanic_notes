- Survived is numeric boolean
- Sometimes multiple consecutive commas (maybe empty cells?)
- From line 201, separator changes to semi-colon ;
- Name and surnames in the "Name" column are separated by semi-colons, too..

Might be easiest just to replace all commas with semi-colons, since numbers are using dots for decimals.

maybe:
sed 's/,/;/g' titanic.csv > cleaned_titanic.csv
